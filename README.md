# Project Description:

The McMaster GSA softball league is used every summer by 30-40 teams and as many as 1,000 unique participants. The league is currently organized through 1 an old software platform accessible via a web browser. However, it is outdated and does not include features for administrators to maintain the site without extensive knowledge of computer programming. The capstone team will be responsible for a complete site review, including all functionalities such as scheduling, division management, communication between captains, waiver management, rescheduling, score and league standings management, and other tasks identified by the capstone teams and the client. The capstone team would then be responsible for creating a web-based service with the same functionalities, but in an updated form that enables league and schedule management from a convenient user interface (specific access privileges for team representatives and league administrators). The GSA league is aware that paid-for and ad-supported services are available, and features present in those applications should be explored and added. The GSA league is a minimal-cost non-profit and would like a personalized platform to operate without committing to paid-for services.
