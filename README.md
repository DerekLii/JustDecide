# Project Description:

Indecision in group settings can significantly hinder productivity and lead to frustration among members. This issue can arise from varying perspectives and interests, which can result in endless discussions without reaching a conclusion. Social dynamics, such as power imbalances and fear of conflict, further complicate the decision-making process, as dominant personalities may overshadow quieter voices and individuals hesitate to express differing opinions. 

We aim to address these challenges and improve group decision making scenarios by providing a tool for groups to use with a structured, automated approach for coming to a conclusion. By reducing indecision, groups can transform hesitancy and delays into decisive action, enhancing productivity and cohesiveness.

The JustDecide app is a web-based platform designed to facilitate collaborative decision-making among groups. DecisionMaker will streamline the process of gathering opinions and reaching consensus on various decisions.
